# AI Desktop Voice Assistant

## Project Overview

#### Project goal:
The goal of this project is to create an AI virtual desktop assistant that can help users with their daily tasks. The assistant should be able to understand natural language commands and respond in a human-like way. It should also be able to access and control information on the user's computer. This python AI project contains information about how to make a virtual assistant like Iron man Jarvis in python.
 J.A.R.V.I.S is a Voice Activated Desktop Assistant which will accept your commands and do as what it programmed to do.

#### Project scope: The project will focus on the following features:
**Natural language understanding:** The assistant should be able to understand natural language commands, such as "Open Google Chrome" or "Play music."

**Human-like response:** The assistant should be able to respond to user queries in a human-like way. For example, it should be able to answer questions, provide summaries of information, or make recommendations.

**Information access and control:** The assistant should be able to access and control information on the user's computer. For example, it should be able to open files, launch applications, or change settings.

## Important Liabraries 
**1) Pyttsx3 :-**

The pyttsx3 module is a Python library that provides text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities. It is a cross-platform library that supports 
various TTS engines.Pyttsx3 can be used to create applications that can speak text, such as virtual assistants, educational software, and games. It can also be used to convert text to speech for accessibility purposes.
Pyttsx3 supports various TTS engines, including SAPI5 on Windows, NSSpeechSynthesizer on macOS, and eSpeak on Linux.

**2) SAPI5 :-**

SAPI is an speech API developed by Microsoft to allow the use of speech recognition and speech synthesis within Windows applications.
In Python, SAPI5 can be used with the pyttsx3 module to create applications that can speak text.

**3) speechRecognition module :-**

The SpeechRecognition module in Python is a library that provides speech recognition capabilities. It supports a variety of speech recognition engines, including Google Speech Recognition, Microsoft Speech Recognition, and IBM Watson Speech to Text.

SpeechRecognition can be used to create applications that can recognize speech, such as virtual assistants, transcription software, and games. It can also be used to convert speech to text for accessibility purposes.

**4) smtplib :-**

The smtplib module in Python is a library that provides Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) client capabilities. It can be used to send emails from a Python script.

SMTP is a protocol that is used to send email messages between mail servers. It is a reliable and well-established protocol that is used by most email providers.
